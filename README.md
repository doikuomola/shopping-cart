# shopping-cart

This is a MERN Stack shopping Cart i learnt on youtube.
In this project, i have learnt how to build my custom api from backend using nodejs, express and mongo db ad=s the database.

In the frontend, i have learnt how to implement redux in reactjs.


It was fun building this kind of project, and i hope to learn and develop more in MERN Stack development.
